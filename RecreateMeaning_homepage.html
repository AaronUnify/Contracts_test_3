<br>


<br><br>
<p>
The problem of problems is that once a specific problem has been solved, a new problem emerges to take its place.
If you're alive you have to deal with the problem of problems. Problems disrupt our experience by generating negative emotion. 
Excessive negative emotion can impact our ability to live a meaningful life as well as have health consequences. 
Years of excessive negative emotion can force us onto a path that leads to resentment, regret and isolated suffering. 
Too many problems will complicate your life to the point of collapse*.
<br><br>
Fortunately individual problems can be solved removing that specific element of our suffering and keeping us on a meaningful path through life.
Just because problems are unending does not mean they should be ignored. 
Solving multiple problems causes positive developments to occur in our life because we develop our skills, resilience, and reputation. 
Therefore, the best way to prepare for future problems is to gain experience solving our current problems. 
<br><br>
The current imperfections of the world are the generators of future problems. 
Before continuing this train of thought, I wish to take a moment to acknowledge that societies will always be plagued by evil people who exploite others vulnerabilities. 
I will talk about protecting yourself from problems caused by evil in future articles, but in this article we are attempting to make peace with the fact that even without evil there is always problems. 
Our goal is to meet our problems with the understanding that if it wasn't this, it would be something else and the best pathway forward is to take corrective action. 
<br><br>
Solving one problem increases the chance of successfully solving future problems. Experience is without a doubt the best teacher. 
There is however, two forces operating independent of evil, although not always mutually exclusive, that generate a large proportion of the worlds problems, scarcity and uncertainty. 
Scarcity and uncertainty exist at every level of existence and continually generate problems for people. 
<br><br>
It may not be possible to erase scarcity and uncertainty, likely they will always be at the frontier of your problems, but it is possible to reduce them. 
To reduce scarcity become more efficient, to reduce uncertainty adopt superior strategy. 
Efficiency allows you to do more, with less. Strategy allows you to account for and mitigate both expected and unexpected outcomes.

<div class="collumn">
           <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">The Money Problem</span><p><span class="headline hl6">The root of all evil?</span></p></div>
           
<p>
The money problem is when you're lacking the required resources to be able to make the choices that would allow for a unique path through life. Instead finding yourself following a well trodden path of financial scarcity, forced to devote a lifetime of attention and energy to the task of survival.  
<br><br>
Increased freedom, security, novelty and health can all be purchased with money. Some claim that "money is the root of all evil", but like many common sayings this misquote has lost its original meaning. The full quote is "For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." It's a warning that the yearning for money above all else causes suffering and it holds true for most things, not just money. 
<br><br>
Rather than being the root to all evil, money is a means to an end. The end being the pursuit of a meaningful life that is beneficial to the earth and other people. A meaningful life as determined by your own standards. Ultimately, the actual amount of money you require is up to you. For those that have yet to determine what a meaningful life looks like to you, check out our article discussing the meaning problem here. In the meantime, the process of solving the money problem can be a source of temporary meaning if your calling is taking time to emerge. 
<br><br>
For the most part you get money when you earn it by generating value for someone who's willing to pay. In most economies, provided you're capable of generating value and your negotiating skills are up to date, attaining some money should be possible. To avoid the root of all evil problems, you must identify win-win situations that allow both parties in the transaction to benefit. Otherwise you risk failing to provide value and alienating yourself from future trade in your pursuit of money.
<br><br>
The majority of the population obtains an income by working for an employer who has hired them to perform general tasks relating to a specific skill set. The experience and steady income gained from employment can be enough to set a strategic person's finances up for life if the correct strategies are pursued. The first step is to identify a way to generate excess income. 
<br><br>
Excess income can be used to generate interest, saving some money today means your income will be boosted in the future. A shortage of money can require you to go into debt to cover your expenses which will generate interest against you and serve as a burden on your future income. Understanding these basic principles of money are foundational to any efficient strategy. 
<br><br>
Let's talk more specifically about strategies for investing your excess income to attain the necessary wealth to fund a meaningful life. These are not foolproof, but in general they have a higher chance of success than many other strategies.The value of $1,000,000.00 has been selected arbitrarily to demonstrate the potential of these strategies.

            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">Falling in Love with "Falling in Love"</span><p><span class="headline hl6">By William John Tulloch</span></p></div>

																   
																   
		
       
           <p> Not only was I looking for love everywhere I looked but I was not even using my eyes or heart. Relationship after relationship would come and fall and it was fleeting in the experience of filling a deep emptiness. </p>
					
<br> <br>

<h1> The Problem </h1> 

<br>

<p>The problem here is that I was addicted to the feeling and idea of falling in love and being in a relationship. The parts of myself that were calling these to the forefront was my inability to incorporate the individually repressed parts of my personal unconscious into my true self. Instead, I was looking for these in the external world in others that were not even in the other person. I was falling in love with the concept of the opposite gender rather than the person themselves e.g Falling in love with "falling in love". </p>

<span class="headline hl2">The Animus and The Anima </span>

<br>

<p> "I was constantly looking for someone to fix me regardless of if they were healthy themselves". The concept here is based on a Carl Jung Archetype of the Animus/Anima being the concept of soul in the masculine and feminine. The concepts here in a basic form is the longing for elements of the opposite internal traits within the opposite Gender. For the pragmatic understanding these opposites can have a projecting effect of what the psyche sees as the individual’s potential to embody parts of the self that are underdeveloped and potentially exist in other people (particularly a significant other). The Animus/Anima is the archetype we look for within the other individual to complete a functioning relationship. </p>

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath

<div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">The Line between Dreams and the Self </span><p><span class="headline hl4">by FRANZ KAFKA</span></p></div><p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>
					
					<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
