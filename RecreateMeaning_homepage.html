						</figure>	



<p>If you're alive you have problems. Problems disrupt our experience by generating negative emotion. 
Excessive negative emotion can block our ability to live a meaningful life. 
Forcing us onto a path that leads to resentment, regret and bitter suffering. 
<br><br>
Fortunately individual problems can be solved reducing our suffering and keeping us on a meaningful path through life, but in time new problems emerge. 
The problem of problems is unending and should not be ignored. Too many problems will complicate your life to the point of collapse*. 
<br><br>
The current imperfections of the world are the generators of future problems. 
I wish to acknowledge that societies will always be plagued by evil people who exploite others' vulnerabilities. 
I would like to talk more about solutions to problems caused by evil in future articles. 
For now I want to talk about two of the biggest causes of problems in the world, scarcity and uncertainty. 
Scarcity and uncertainty exist independent of evil at every level of existence and continually generate problems for people. 
<br><br>
I would like to focus on scarcity and uncertainty because they have partial answers. 
It may not be possible to erase scarcity and uncertainty, but it is possible to reduce them. 
To reduce scarcity become more efficient, to reduce uncertainty adopt superior strategy. 
<br><br>
Choosing to filter your decision making through a lense of efficiency and strategy gives a framework for evaluating your own actions. 
The goal of efficiency is to do more with what you have, the goal of strategy is eliminate potential negative outcomes while conserving expected and better than expected outcomes.

<p>
Freedom, time, security, novelty and health can all be purchased with money. 
Some will claim that "money is the root of all evil", but like many common sayings this is a misquote. 
The full quote is "For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."  
It's a warning that the yearning for money above all else causes corruption. 
<br><br>
For the most part you get money when you earn it by generating value for someone who's willing to pay. . 
In most economies provided your capable of generating value and your negotiating skills are up to date, attaining some money should be possible. 
To avoid the root of all evil problem, you must identify win-win situations that allow both parties in the transaction to benefit. 
Otherwise you risk failing to provide value and alienating yourself from future trade in your pursuit of money. 
<br><br>
Often an employer will pay one person for many generalised tasks (i.e. a job), relating to a specific skillset. 
The exerience and steady income gained in these situations can be enough to set a strategic person's finances up for life. 
<br><br>
These are the basic guidelines of money that are foundational to any efficient strategy. 
An excess of money will generate interest, not spending today means your income will be boosted in the future. 
A shortage of money will require you to go into debt to cover your expenses. 
Debt will generate interest against you and serve as a burden on your future income.  
<br>

						</figure>	

<br>
	
	
The goal is to accumulate enough money to live a meaningful life. 
A meaningful life by your own standards. How much you need is up to you. 
The process of solving the money problem can be a great time to explore the meaning problem if it's giving you difficulty. 
You can begin solving the money problem without a plan for once you have your fortune. 
<br><br>
Lets talk strategy for going $0.00 to $1,000,000...

            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">Falling in Love with "Falling in Love"</span><p><span class="headline hl6">By William John Tulloch</span></p></div>

																   
																   
		
           <p> Not only was I looking for love everywhere I looked but I was not even using my eyes or heart. Relationship after relationship would come and fall and it was fleeting in the experience of filling a deep emptiness. </p>
					

<span class="headline hl2">The Animus and The Anima </span>

<br>

<p> "I was constantly looking for someone to fix me regardless of if they were healthy themselves". The concept here is based on a Carl Jung Archetype of the Animus/Anima being the concept of soul in the masculine and feminine. The concepts here in a basic form is the longing for elements of the opposite internal traits within the opposite Gender. For the pragmatic understanding these opposites can have a projecting effect of what the psyche sees as the individualâs potential to embody parts of the self that are underdeveloped and potentially exist in other people (particularly a significant other). The Animus/Anima is the archetype we look for within the other individual to complete a functioning relationship. </p>

<br>

<h1> The Dark Road Ahead </h1>

<br> 

<p> Overall, this impacts the individual on levels of personal confidence, emotional stability, coping ability and awareness of our own wants. Break up after break up will occur and questions of personal illness will begin to plague the mind. The inability to hold a consistent style of living with unnecessary sacrifice means that elements of life will go neglected and habits of overcompensation towards "making it work" will become primary. This will ultimately lead to a breakdown in useful coping strategies and obsession can become apparent. After these precursors have been run to its conclusions the individual will become lost in their own direction and ultimately decide to live a life of unfulfilled loneliness. In summary, looking for somebody else to fill a empty part of your psyche will result in co-dependency, empty connections and toxic relationships. </p>

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath

<div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">The Line between Dreams and the Self </span><p><span class="headline hl4">by FRANZ KAFKA</span></p></div><p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>
					
					<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
