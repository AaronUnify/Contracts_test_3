						</figure>	



<p>

Welcome to the secret part of the article. 
<br><br>
I've been spending a fair of time sitting alone and writing now. 
I rarely get to talk philosphy in the real world because I work in a restaurant and I tend to dislike meeting new people. 
Hence, I can only harass a new staff member with wild speculations about the nature of reality for a limited amount of time before they shut me out.  
My self imposed social limitations have led to a kind of isolated philosopher situation. 
<br><br>
I could engage in philosophy before I was aware of the major schools of philosophy. 
I began noting my discoveries about the nature of reality before reading any works of philosophy. 
<br><br>
When I was around 16, I was taught a basic version of Charles Darwins theory of evolution and I had a lightbulb moment. 
I now knew a formalised way of stating that living things change across their iterations through time, inline with challenges presented by the environment. 
I knew that non-living things change in relation to the environment as well, typically eroding or decaying. 
So the question became, what things defy this standard of existence. 
What non-living things are self-sustaining, even transforming into a higher state of existence? 
<br><br>
I began to take note of the things that didn't erode or decay. 
Things that grew, but were not alive. 
At first things like, rivers and avalanches, got my attention, but I started to see this phenoma in the social world. 
Things like rumors getting out of control initially. 
Followed by people taking stances for or against, things, people, and ideas. 
<br><br>
I began to notice that the things that were in the everybody permanantly dislikes category had traits. 
So did the things in the permanant like pool. 
As novel phenomena were sent my way I could predict how my reaction and my friends reaction would differ. 
Sometimes I would like something, but I knew my friends wouldn't so I would keep my like of it secret.
Sometimes I would see something I didn't like but I could predict that some of the people around me would like it. 
<br><br>
This evolved into noticing that the like and dislike of certain things varied amongst personality types. 
If there were three people of a certain personality who like something, a fourth person of that personality type will probably like it too. 
Leading me to begin to form preconceptions of people based on first impressions. 
<br><br>
Often my preconceptions are wrong and that is a good thing. 
If I can simulate a person in my mind based off of personality averages there is not much point actually meeting them. 
But if they vary in some way from my preconception I want to know how. 
If at least because I need to know who can do what and how should I treat them. 
<br><br>
But really, I want to know what questions their experience has answered. 
Often times people have found novel ways to interact with the world that I can benefit from if I can understand the person. 
I can't simulate what I don't know so its best to let individuality shine in actual interaction. 
<br><br>
In particular I like the people who are working on figuring things out. 
Because outside of my direct experience I'm left with simulation. 
It's a struggle to simulate someone elses experience, even with many pages of description, nothing beats the actual experience. 
So the next best thing that I want to know is the information that they have generated from their experiences. 
Because there is a chance that a combination of their experiences has led to a revaltion that I'll never haveo on my own.  
<br><br>
This didn't make me a philosopher. This made me a sort of collector of information. 
My philsophy was brewing in the form of watching events unfold and seeing how they varied from my expectation. 
At times I watched from a distance, asking people internal and external to the event what they thought would happen. 
Other times it was me in the event trying to predict the future and use my information to make it a favourable outcome.
<br><br>
What came next was the discovery that I could predict and manipulate the future using the information I was collecting. 
Instead of allowing my own experience to lead me into what I sensed would be an unfavourable outcome, I could supplement my plans with the information other people had generated. 
<br><br>
This is a highly-experimental way of living. The combinations of certain facts create uncertain outcomes. 
The ability to predict what will happen from experience becomes increasingly watered down as the combination of part-truths can create something that is more false than the initial facts. 
<br><br>
The threat is that in response to unexpected outcomes, the thing that is taken to be insufficient is the information derived from personal experience, not the information derived from combining external part truths. 
This leads to a dismissal of the information derived from personal experience, in favour of externally generated information. 
<br><br>
In a healthy mind, part-truths attained from external sources are weighed against personal experience to see if any utility can be gained. 
In an unhealthy mind, part-truths gain primacy and their errors are unexamined. These part-truths are then used to evaluate the need for additional external ideas and personal experience. 
The result is a misinformed person, who exists as a composite of socially accepted ideas exempt from analysis, who distrusts their personal experience. 
<br><br>
A descent into complex misunderstanding generates error. 
The truth is required to untangle the mind. 
But to those who have both lost the truth, and the ability to observe the world through a clean lens the truth can be hard to find. 
<br><br>
So what makes the truth, the truth? 
The truth is not just what was and is, the truth is what will be, and sometimes in what is and was there is a reflection of what will be. 
In fact, the moment where what will be becomes clear, is the moment when a cascade of events has been triggered that can not be stopped.   
Something is true, when despite your interference it can not be changed. b
Therefore your understanding of how to predict the events of your environment is your knowledge of truth. 
<br><br>
An appearance of traits in events, similar to previous events can be an indicator that a cascade is approaching. 
Around the time that the present begins to resemble the past, we're standing in a new moment of truth. 
Analysing moments of truth closely can reveal their origin
<br><br>
Because we share the world, and we share experience of events, my truth and your truth may be very similar. 
The risk and benefit is in the differnces, you may be able to teach me how to trigger cascades in the environment that work in my favour, and I may be able to do the same for you. 
Whether or not our understanding of events is accurate enough to trigger the appopriate cascade is only knowable by putting it into action. 
However, this is not meant to be taken as an arguement against collecting information. 
<br><br>
I am talking about this because Hermits were often seen as sources of wisdom and I'd like to put forward my theory as to why. 
I just implied the existence of a form of social information, derived from the experience of other people. 
I spoke of the risk of picking up part truths that cause harm in the process. 

Well let's consider a differnt kind of truth. The kind that emerges from observing nature. 
Remember I proposed that truth is what happens, regardless of your interference.
Nature happens without intervention, it's a form of evolving processes without a guiding hand. 
<br><br>
Nature was happening before we arrived. Nature will be happening after we're gone. 
Even if the nature is absent from organic life, for a time. 
<br><br>
Nature can provide for us if we coexist with it. 
Society is a crutch for those of us who cannot establish this relationship. 
A crutch which we have built into our phsyiology. 
<br><br>
To avoid the risk of catastrophic error, we should implent the fragements of truth gained from other people within the constraints of natural law and processes. 
That way we mix the truth of our experience, with the truth of the experience of others and stabalise it with the truth of what would be if we weren't around. 
Hermits seem the best positioned to gain that latter part of this ability because they are spending more time obeserving nature than people who are hardwired into society. 
Therefore, when no one can think of a good solution, ask a hermit. 
First of all their answer may not be corrupted by the experience and corrosponding beliefs of the group. 
Secondly they may be able to weave an alternative strategy in line with natural patterns that constantly reinvigorate the new idea, preventing the process from stopping even if people stop participating in the belief. 
<br><br>
Ideas that change from human behaviour and cascade into natural processes are part of the shamanic toolkit. 
Interestingly this toolkit often preposes that human progress has moved away from a natural ideal and needs to be corrected. 
Often in reality this is because the socailised people have reached a dead-end and have decided to ask the Hermit. 
By this point they usually have asked everyone else, and if they had an answer, they just didn't bother asking the Hermit.  
If the Hermit is a good shaman they will channel a perspective derived from nature. 
If the Hermit is a good shaman, they will wait to be asked. 
<br><br>
For the shaman to put their ideas forward first, they are participating in society. 
They lose their shamanic quality and become just another member of the crowd. 
This is because ideas are never imagined entirely free from the direct constraints of natural processes. 
Everyone has experience with the natural unfolding of things, so in a way we are all capable of shamanic thinking. 
<br><br>
It's really the exclusion of social influence that makes the shaman particularily useful for generating novel solutions. 
So to the degree to which we gain experience by working with nature, without including the beliefs and patterns of the crowd, we'll avoid running into the same barriers as everyone else. 
This is useful because it appears many people are blindly approaching the same cliff.
