								<figcaption class="figcation">Welcome to the secret part of the article. </figcaption>
						</figure>	


<br>
<p>
<br><br>
Welcome to the secret part of the article. 
<br><br>
I face the same struggles as most writers who are unknown, namely that no one reads what I write. 
This suits me because I'm introverted by nature and other people wear me down. 
But, I feel an obligation to share information if I think it could help someone. 
This is a discussion of truth which I think may help introverts find their place in this changing world. 
<br><br>
First off if you're introverted, all of the non-secret part of the article applies to you, this is in addition. 
If you're extraverted, feel free to read ahead. 
I believe that anyone can walk the path of the introvert, just that some are called to it. 
<br><br>
I'm a few competing things but one of my natural tendencies is to seek a safe and isolated space. 
I noticed at a young age that the marjority of socialising was unecessary and I still don't seem to take the same pleasure in it as others.  
I don't want exclusion, I just want to be left alone to do what I'm doing unless I'm needed. 
Another, trait which I think is related to introversion is that I don't want to be taught how to do things, I much rather to figure it out for myself.  
<br><br>
My introversion caused a lot of trouble for me initially, occasionaly it still does but it's much more manageable now. 
My goal with this article is to formalise a way to set up your life so that extroverts will back off and let you do your thing. 
Being introverted can be a source of advantage if you know how to weild it. 
<br><br>

</p>

<div class = "strategy">
Three Types of Truth
<br><br>
<p>
1. Personal Truth: Information from lived experience. <br> 
2. Social Truth: Information from others. <br> 
3. Natural Truth: What exists without human intervention. <br> 
</p>
</div> 

<p> 
The first thing to understand is that introverts have a different source of truth than extraverts. 
Extraverts outsource a lot of their thinking to other people by constantly asking questions. 
This fills them with a general truth and the confidence that their belief is the accepted answer. 
<br><br>
Introverts balance the cost of asking a question with the price of just figuring out the answer. 
That sounds funny to extraverted people because they don't seem to understand that I have finite energy for socialising. 
So finite, that I'll look for something before I ask where it is and I'll interact with something before I ask what it does. 
As much as possible, I'll figure out how to do things myself before I ask for help. 
Without intellect, I think introverts struggle. 
I have enough intellect to get by, although figuring things out for myself slowed me down a little initially. 
<br><br>
Introverts gain a higher proportion of their understanding of the world from interacting with things and analysing their lived experience. 
Initially not asking for help handicaps a person, but after a time it turns to advantage. 
I used to break nearly everything I tried to fix with little success. 
Now my fail rate is very low, I fix just about everything. 
Years of practice has led me to gain an increasingly large, things and how they work knowledge structure. 
<br><br>
Sometimes an introvert can discover something and gain the attention of the extroverts. 
This leads to the extraverts asking the introvert questions. 
The introverts answers are shared, but are often taken to by the extraverts as being awkward and hard to understand. 
This is because the introverts are drawing from a different source of truth, sometimes at a very deep level. 
The default state is miscommunication, because the introverts aren't relaying on social truth to guide their understanding. 
Often communication is just not possible. 
<br><br>
It's easier for introverts to understand extraverts because extraverts are drawing from the same shared social truth. 
Most extraverts have common beliefs because they asked someone once, and accepted the answer. 
Introverts are often good at predicting what other people will say based off of their past interactions with that kind of person because they understand the social truth. 
<br><br>

<div class = "strategy">
Dangers of Being Introverted
<br><br>
<p>
1. Development: Being a late bloomer, a never bloomer, or blooming into something that is considered heretical. <br> 
2. Vulnrability: Bullies, rapists, pedophiles, narcissists and aggresive people choose quiet people as their targets. <br> 
3. Exclusion: If you're not fun at parties, you don't get invited to parties. <br> 
</p>
</div> 
<br><br>
It can be a hard time if your attention tends to drift inward. 
There is no shortage of people looking to take advantage of other people if they think they can get away with it. 
If an introvert is in your care, you need to give them the skills to protect themselves as well as teach them about the dangers of the world, because they're the ones most likely to slip through the cracks of social protection.  
<br><br>
It's easy for people who are determined to control social truth for their own purposes to run a successful smear campaign on an introvert because the introvert is the most likely to be blind to people talking behind their back. 
It's also easier for groups of bullies or worse to catch an introvert alone and out of sight, because that's where the introvert wants to be. 
Aggresive people often back down when met with resistence. Introverts are the last to learn this and the most likely to get attacked randomly because someone else is having a bad day. 
<br><br>
These situations often lead to a strong resentment for other people in introverts. 
A natural feeling of nervousness and exhaustion from crowds is coupled with experiences of terrible people who seek vulnerable targets. 
Never safe in a group, never safe alone, being introverted is a positive feedback loop of isolation pushing introverts further and further outside of the regular social structure. 
<br><br>
Personally, I think the marjority of people are a major hassle to deal with in general, and at times you're all a murderous bunch, but I have people I care about deeply. 
This means I feel an obligation to stop as many people as I can from running head on into the catastrophe of poverty and disease that our current society is hurtling towards. 
This is the purpose of the non-secret part of the article. 
<br><br>
I'm writing this part because introverts have two special roles in minimising the coming catastrophe. 
The first bit is easy to explain, population density has become a source of pandemic risk. 
Not just covid but new diseases. Anti-biotics, hand-sanitiser and anti-bacterial cleaners used at this scale will generate some terrible diseases. 
I don't see us stopping the excessive use of hand-sanitiser and anti-bacterial cleaners until it's too late. 
However, population density, I can do something about because a bunch of us introverts want to leave anyway. 
I'm proposing that we move rural. 
<br><br>
A rural life promises daily interaction with animals, plants, and machines with the added benefit of seeing less people. 
Plus the property is about half the price of in the city. 
<br><br>
For the great introvert migration to get underway we need to figure out how to make this work financially, I write an investment strategy in the non-secret article that will suffice for purchasing land. 
But making money off the land is it's own trouble. 
Farming looks like a tough industry to crack although, the work on regenerative agriculture looks promising. 
<br><br>
Homesteading to reduce expenses while working online seems like an easier source of income for the first years. 
Renting cabins or working a local rural job are also possible sources of income. 
I have another idea for us to make money that I hope will come to fruition, but it's likely years off. 
<br><br> 
<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> 

-----Unfinished--------

Revelations about the way things are structured are more likely to appear from an observation of how things are if you're not there. 
<br><br>
A useful style of thinking can begin from a hero-complex. 
If you find yourself wondering what would have happened if you weren't there to stop things going wrong then you're on the doorstep of being a useful introvert. 
Because you're only temporary, so eventually you won't be around. 
Plus, if you've probably got hermit aspirations you won't be around earlier than most. 
<br><br>
Intoverts are adapted to death, they do their own thinking, contrast it with the social belief, look into the future for disaster and correct it in real time. 

Intro means inwardly, vert means turn.
