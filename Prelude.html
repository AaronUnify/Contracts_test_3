Prelude

I want to talk about my dreams. I think there is something here which is important. For this book there is a picture in my head of how everything should be laid out, but when I attempt to write it in words I go off track. Iâm going to try to keep this on course and get to the conclusion, but along the way we need to make many stops. 

Iâm not sure we can just begin, I think I need to tell you what I think dreams are and why I have confidence in them. So my apologies but Iâm writing a prelude. 



<hr class = "line14"><hr class = "line14">


<br><br>
<br><br>
At my highest level of thinking I'm most confident with prophecies derived from dreams. I can be rigorous and scientific but I donât find it useful for my needs. Iâd rather be blind than wrong. 
<br><br>
If a single fact underpinning an idea is wrong, then the idea is dangerous. If a few ideas are combined into some form of knowledge system, the system is likely to produce results that cause harm. Because I donât have enough true facts, I continually update my ideas but I never believe them or even take them seriously.  
<br><br>
If I find myself in a position where I need to rely on my own ideas, I prepare for the worst. If I find myself relying on someone else's ideas, I really prepare for the worst. Because I donât know enough to have my own ideas, let alone someone else's. Even if an expert was right, I probably wouldnât understand the reasoning, to be able to execute the ideas well. 
<br><br>
But at this point things are going well for me. Theyâve actually been going well for a while. Because I think my understanding is wrong, I expect the unexpected will happen. This means I prepare for things that could go wrong. Because I prepare for the worst, not what is likely, I tend to do better than average when things go wrong. I also tend to do better than average when things go right, because Iâm well positioned to maneuver out of the way of a collapse, meaning I can easily maneuver to take advantage of a good opportunity. 
<br><br>
If you do better than average for a while your life tends to improve. If you are using the gains from your success to prepare for more of the unexpected, a positive feedback loop of stability forms. Success and stability is an emergent property of my system of belief that brands every idea as dangerously wrong. I will take success and stability over well-reasoned stupidity anyday. 
<br><br>
Interestingly, there is one form of irrational knowledge generation that seems to be especially useful for someone running the same model as me: the knowledge that is presented in dreams. Because I donât trust anything to be true, my mind is open to any source of information. I evaluate ideas on whether or not they are useful to me at the time. For whatever reason dreams are consistently very useful. 
<br><br>
A small example of the kind of thing I want to discuss in this book. 


<br><br>
<br>


<div class = "strategy">
<strong>The Cyclops</strong>
<br><br>
<p>

In late 2019 I had a dream that a cyclops was attacking my apartment building. He was easily four-stories tall and was going window to window looking inside peoples apartments. 
<br>
In the dream our apartment had an extra room, a storeroom full of supplies. We planned to stay inside until the cyclops was gone. 
<br>
I felt fearful that we did not have enough supplies and would not survive long enough to outlast the cyclops<br>
</p>
</div> 
<br><br>




<br><br>
<br>


It was not long after this dream that Covid and the lockdowns began. Likely this dream was coincidence but the fear I experienced in the dream helped me react swiftly when Covid arrived. Once it was announced that we were being locked into our homes. I moved us to a house with a yard as quickly as possible. Because we were early on the move, we were fortunate enough to purchase our home before the property prices in our area skyrocketed. 
<br><br>
When I learned of Covid I thought to myself, this is the same feeling I had regarding the Cyclops. I must not let this trap me in my one-bedroom apartment. I was able to figure out how to achieve my goal because I have an economics degree. We had a need for a house outside of surviving a pandemic. I could make a solid economic argument for my decisions at the time, but really it was a strange nightmare that primed me to be terrified of being trapped in my home. 
<br><br>
Itâs in this strange way that my truest and most useful insights come from dreams. So when I have an especially vivid dream I write it down and I spend years analysing it. If I think hard about a dream I form a knowledge structure that uses the symbolic representations of my unconscious mind to predict events and inform me of the structure of things.  
<br><br>
There is surprising consistency to the symbolism of my dreams. Interestingly the symbolism remains constant across different dreams that are months or years apart. Some of the symbolic representations that have emerged from the depths of my mind are very specific, but as far as I remember prior to dreaming them I had no conscious familiarity with them. This leads me to suspect that there is an unconscious structure within me that generates these temporary realities using representations that come from outside of my personal experience. 
<br><br>
By continually performing dream analysis I think I am opening the connection between my conscious and unconscious mind. I suspect that by making conscious associations with the unconscious symbolic structure that resides in my mind, I am increasing the likelihood of having meaningful dreams. 
<br><br>
My intuition is that our minds are full of âcategories of understanding prior to experienceâ perhaps from birth we are preloaded on the cusp of certain insights. I suspect that when we have a new experience in the waking world the brain loads the memory of the new experience into one of our âcategories of understanding prior to experienceâ through dreaming. If the memory fits the pre-existing category the dream will be meaningful and insight about a possible future will be attained. An added benefit is that you have a better understanding of the experience because your mind has devoted resources to understanding that type of experience in advance. 
<br><br>
I believe that some âcategories of understanding prior to experienceâ are coded into our physiology. I donât intend to develop this hypothesis but letâs speculate on anatomy. Human brains are for the most part structured in a similar way at birth and they are capable of learning. We are also born with instincts. Therefore, itâs not a stretch to expect the brain to have âcategories of understanding prior to experienceâ at the point of birth. I suspect that the brain retains the ability to develop âcategories of understanding prior to experienceâ after birth. I believe this is part of the physiological infrastructure related to learning. 
<br><br>
My next leap of faith is that dreams are related to this infrastructure and therefore should not be ignored. I donât expect to ever understand the emergence of dreams, I only hope to understand their content. 
<br><br>
Before we go too much further I ask that as a reader you understand that when Iâm guessing just go with it. Donât believe the facts that I write, I donât. In this book itâs the anecdotal stuff that warrants your attention. If you're the type of person who uses the limits of someone's understanding provided in good faith as an opportunity to attack that person for not knowing your version of the facts then this is not the book for you and you're not fun to be around. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Dreams are strange because they allow us to provide anecdotes of events that happened outside of this reality. The act of speech is about as strange as dreaming. It is also a behaviour that most humans seem primed for developing. 
<br><br>
I think a baby learns to talk after being born because it has some form of preloaded âcategories of understanding prior to experienceâ. At the very least we can say that the baby has ears, the ability to make sound, nerves and a brain. The physical hardware of the human body probably comes with some base model software for identifying and learning language. Which is strange because we havenât had such sophisticated language for very long. 
<br><br>
Our talking ancestors are predated by non-talking ancestors who I suspect for a while there was an overlap between the ability to speak and the invention of language sufficient for conveying narrative. There has likely been a constant arms race between the development of the capacity for language and the development of language. I mean that you could understand the world better if you had richer words. 
<br><br>
I suspect our ancestors began ascending into intelligence by observing the natural world and the behaviour of others. Filling their memories with information about their social group and environment. This is a powerful ability when competing against those who run purely on instinct. 
<br><br>
After observing the natural world and the behaviour of others for a while, ancestors with understanding needed to develop language to help communicate insight with others. Especially in times of changing environments and in response to new technology. 
<br><br>

Across time language has developed in sophistication. As a species we have gained the ability to represent experiences with words. The ability to share experience through narrative flips the natural model of understanding. Usually instinct would be primary, followed by understanding gained from experience.  
<br><br>
Instead, we often hear and read multiple narratives about a type of experience before we gain personal experience. We are full of âcategories of understanding without prior experience or even observationâ. 
<br><br>
If we can understand a naturally occuring category of understanding then we can identify axioms of human nature. Alternatively the categories of understanding that we develop in life through shared narratives allow us to understand the axioms of our society. 
<br><br>
Note that societies exist on multiple scales. The axioms that describe your town may be different from the axioms that describe your family or the greater territory of the area. 
<br><br>
If a narrative struggles to break out of one geographical region or time period it may work only as a description of that region or time. Alternatively it could be that other regions have similar or competing narratives serving the same purpose. 
<br><br>
In the same way that the long occurring phenomena within nature become incorporated into our physiology. A long-standing narrative within a society can become structural to the society. Sometimes serving as the link between that society and nature, other times serving as the link between the individual and the rest of the population. 
<br><br>
But not every structure of society is built upon narrative. Some societal structures emerge from the unconscious desires of many people. It is also the case that societies can clash or harmonise with the autonomous forces of nature. This means that the structure of our society can leave individuals prone to categories of experience outside of the narrative description possible with the current language. 
<br><br>
Because of this understanding the world using narrative is insufficient. What is needed is a type of narrative that allows individuals to experience both the conscious and unconscious elements of their mind while examining the structure of their society and the natural world. 
<br><br>
Dreams are what is required to keep pace with an impossibly complex and ever changing world. 
<br><br>
Dreams must be capable of stitching together the âcategories of understanding without prior experienceâ with the memory of personal experience to create links and reveal insight. A meaningful insight can reveal an understanding of the unconscious processes that direct the individuals behaviour. A prophetic level insight can allow for conscious control of the unconscious forces that drive society to be taken. 
<br><br>

The final point regarding the nature of dreams is that in the waking world similarities between experiences can be identified and converted into categories of understanding. In dreams this process is reversed, categories of understanding are converted into experience. 
<br><br>
With this hypothesis in mind we can begin an analysis of the dreams that I feel are best suited for gaining insight into the structure of our society and how we should live.
