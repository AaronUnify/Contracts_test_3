<p> 
<br><br>
<br><br>
I've decided to try a new writing style. I have attempted to write other books and articles but I struggle to finish. There is a picture in my head of how everything should be laid out, but when I attempt to write I end up pigeonholed in psychology, economics, or philosophy. 
<br><br>
The problem is that at my core I'm most comfortable in the visionary philosopher style. I can be rigorous and scientific if necessary but my truest and most useful insights come from dreams. My conscious understanding of my own experience or of other people's research and ideas pales compared to my unconscious understanding. So when I have an especially vivid dream I write it down and I spend years analysing it. Often the results of the analysis are a reproduction of someone else's ideas using the symbolic representations my unconscious uses to represent the world and my personal experience. Iâm not sure anything in our dreams is truly original because they seem to be drawing on the world for inspiration. 
<br><br>
There is surprising consistency to the symbolism of my dreams. Interestingly the symbolism remains constant across different dreams that are months or years apart. Some of the symbolic representations that have emerged from the depths of my mind are very specific, but as far as I remember prior to dreaming them I had no conscious familiarity with them. This leads me to suspect that there is an unconscious structure within me that generates these temporary realities in which I am a participant that uses representations that come from outside of my personal experience. 
<br><br>
My intuition is that we are born with a mind primed with categories of understanding prior to experience perhaps preloaded on the cusp of certain insights. I suspect that when we have a new experience in the waking world the brain loads the memory of the new experience into one of the preloaded representations of categories of understanding through dreaming. If the memory fits the pre-existing category the dream will be meaningful and insight will be attained. The result is that you have a better understanding of the experience because your mind was pre-configured to understand that type of experience. 
<br><br>
I believe that certain categories of understanding prior to experience are coded into our physiology. Perhaps in DNA or perhaps just as a result of how the nervous system, or the brain is structured. I donât intend to develop this hypothesis into a scientific one because I am comfortable with the idea that all living and nonliving things contain spirit. If it turns out our dreams are a product of our spirit then so be it. I donât expect to ever understand the emergence of dreams, I only hope to understand their content. 
<br><br>
Before we go too much further I ask that as a reader you understand that when I say "perhaps" or speak of my intuition, I'm at the limit of my knowledge and I'm offering a guess based on my experience. 
<br><br>
This book will contain a central thesis of which I'm confident. As we reach the edge of each of the individual points of my central thesis we will reach my partial understandings and guesses. I'm happy to show you the limits of my understanding as I don't intend to stop learning at this point in my life and spend the rest of my days defending this version of meâs ideas. My hope is that in doing this I may offer a part of the puzzle for someone else, and encourage others to be comfortable publishing guesses. 
<br><br>
However I do want to make it clear. If you're the type of person who uses the limits of someone's understanding provided in good faith as an opportunity to attack that person for not knowing what they readily admit that they don't know then this is not the book for you and you're not fun to be around. 
<br><br>
Back to my intuition of the structure of the mind and the role of dreams. Whatever the mechanism for preloaded categories of understanding prior to direct experience may be, I suspect that it certainly predates language. 
<br><br>

Speech is a behaviour that most humans seem primed for developing. I think a baby learns to talk after being born because it has some form of preloaded categories of understanding prior to experience. At the very least we can say that the baby has ears, the ability to make sound, nerves and a brain. The physical hardware of the human body probably comes with some base model software for identifying and learning language. 
<br><br>
Our first talking ancestors were predated by non talking ancestors who I suspect were also born with preloaded categories of understanding prior to experience. There has likely been an arms race between the development of the capacity for language and the development of language. 
<br><br>
I suspect our early non-talking ancestors began the ascent into intelligence by gaining access to the ability to create categories of understanding without prior experience during their lifetimes. This would have allowed them to create categories of understanding by observing the natural world and the behaviour of others. A powerful ability when competing against those who run purely on instinct. 
<br><br>
After observing the natural world and the behaviour of others for a while, ancestors with understanding needed to develop language to help correct the sub-optimal behaviour of others. Especially in changing environments and in response to new technology.

<br><br>

<p>
Across time language has developed in sophistication. As a species we have gained the ability to represent experiences and actions with words. We have also gained the ability to describe other locations in space and time. 
<br><br>
As language has developed the ability to share experience through narrative has become possible. Hearing multiple narratives about the same phenomenon allows for the creation of a category of understanding without prior experience or even observation. 
<br><br>
I believe the categories of understanding that we are born with exist in response to phenomena that have remained consistent across a long enough span of time to become incorporated in our physiology. Hence if we can understand a naturally occuring category of understanding then we can identify axioms of human nature. 
<br><br>
Alternatively the categories of understanding that we develop in life through shared narratives allow us to understand the axioms of our society. Note that societies exist on multiple scales. The axioms that describe a town may be different than the axioms that describe the greater territory that the town is within. 
<br><br>
An indicator of the usefulness of a narrative for developing categories of understanding is the degree to which the narrative is shared. If a narrative struggles to break out of one geographical region or time period it may work only as a description of that region or time. Alternatively it could be that other regions have similar or competing narratives serving the same purpose. 
<br><br>
In the same way that the long occurring phenomena within nature become incorporated to our physiology. A long-standing narrative within a society can become structural to the society. Sometimes serving as the link between that society and nature, other times serving as the link between the individual and the population. 
<br><br>
But not every structure within society is built upon narrative. Some societal structures emerge to satisfy unconscious desires. It is also the case that societies can clash or harmonise with the forces of nature in ways that no single individual or group consciously directed. Hence it is possible that there can be experience and creation without the emergence of narrative. 
<br><br>
Because the exact cause of the state of things, whether in society or your own life is the result of the conscious choices of many unknown to you and the unconscious processes running without the control, or even guidance of any individual or group that represent the will of the society. Understanding the world using narrative on the level of personal human experience is insufficient. 
<br><br>
A type of narrative that personifies both the conscious and unconscious elements of the individual and their society is required to keep pace with an impossibly complex and ever changing world. This type of narrative is provided by dreams. 
<br><br>
Dreams must be capable of stitching together the categories of understanding without personal experience with the memory of personal experience to create links and reveal insight. If the insight is great, an understanding of the unconscious processes of society which allows for conscious control of the processes to be taken is gained
<br><br>
The memory of personal experience can be converted into categories of experience. I suspect that categories of experience can be converted into personal experience. This is what I guess a dream is. 
<br><br>
With this hypothesis in mind we can begin an analysis of the dreams I have had that I feel are best suited for gaining insight into the structure of our society and how we should live.
