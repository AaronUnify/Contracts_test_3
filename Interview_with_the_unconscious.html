<br><br>
<em><strong>Where do ideas come from?</strong></em> 
<br><br>
Everyone knows that ideas come from social media, but where does social media get its ideas? 
<br><br>
The views of the politcal-left dominate the social media timelines. 
The lefts public displays of compassion and celebration of marginal identities are easier to display publicly than the acts of disgust and righteous anger that the political-right are prone to.  
A sensible person who wanted to share right-wing content would need to share at least 10 leftist acts of compassion just to make their timeline seem balanced. 
Even this ratio is risky becuase right-wing content tends to be more potent because they take a firm stand against something specific rather than celebrating something general. 
<br><br>
This real screenshot shows that when the average person shares videos to their timeline, it looks something like...

</p>


<div class = "screenshot">

<strong>Screenshot #1</strong><br><br>
...<br>
Celebrating Indigenous Culture<br>
Pride Parade 2021<br>

How to save the rainforest<br>
...<br>
<br><br>

Maybe they had a bad day? Maybe an incident happened, maybe an incident involving an immigrant?

This is a Gif of the ice-cream videos where the Turkish guys spin the cone, then I have Ben Shapiro photoshopped in. <br>
The caption reads: BEN SHAPIRO DESTROYS ISLAM! and he's destroying an icecream cone<br><br>
--------------------<br>
-----------<br>
<br><br>
</div>
<br>
Maybe they watched some right-wing content because they were feeling Judgy.  
Oops, they clicked share to timeline. Now they gotta apologize. Why does this keep happening?

Screenshot of out of character right-wing content being shared<br>(leaving the reader outraged!)<br><br>

<br><br>
</div>

<p>
<br>
Because right-wing content is something to be enjoyed with those you trust, not the whole world. 
Right-wing content may not be as present on the timeline, but it dominates the instant messenger inboxes. 
People trust each other with their right-wing content and sometimes this trust is broken. Let's check out this real screenshot of a chatbox with RACIST content.

<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Hey.<br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
Hey, <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
I just realized this could be a way modern way to replicate Jung's handwriting trick for reaching inaccessible parts of the personality. <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
Yes, responding to messages from yourself seems to create some kind of link between parts of the brain that are usually seperated. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
We should do this later, this is going to make the article seem really weird, I already announced this screenshots content? <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
The readers know this isn't a real screenshot. We don't need to be stick to the format.<br> 
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
But we should at least be the characters the audience expects in the dialogue we're performing. <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
No one's going to read this anyway, don't even worry about it. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
If no one's going to read it, why do you fix your typos? <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
Because for the reader the words are already written, they couldn't see me make the change. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
I saw the typo change so I'm confused. Is this just me then? I alone am both the writer and reader?<br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
Never alone, I'm always watching. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Spooky. <br>
<br><br>
-------<br>

</p>
</div>

<p>
*that was weird, I meant to write about racism. <br><br>

So the screenshot didn't really show it but the point was meant to be something like controvesial opinions are a kind of private good, we got off track a little. 
Casting judgement is something that most people are not comfortable with in 99% of situations. 
But in a private inbox sometimes that 1% comes out. 
<br><br>

I'm not really sure what happened in the screenshot sometimes the Jung stuff is truer than expected. Let's just go to the next screenshot. 
<br><br>

Roll the screenshot...

<span class="headline hl3"><strong>Racism begins to spread on social media for the following reason: </strong><br></span>

<br><br>
------------<br><br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Hey, <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
Hey. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
I'm back again to ask your help to do another screenshot. <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
Sure thing, what's this one about? <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
I thought you said you were always watching. I just wrote about it. <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
Oh,  I meant, I am always watching your memories, I don't watch them in chronological order, what's happening up there? <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Man, I'm trying to talk about how racism spreads on social media. <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
That's a really good thing to talk about, when you're finished I would be willing to share this with my followers to spread awareness. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Okay, I'm pretty sure you're messing with me. <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
I can be a bit of a trickster at times, sometimes I pull up seemingly irrelevant memories to make you shudder at your past decisions during the day. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
That's dark bro that's not a trick, pretty sure that's a sign of unprocessed trauma. <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
Yeah, it's probably the reason why you have focus issues sometimes? <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Are you saying that trauma trashes focus? <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
I'm saying that I trash your focus because I have important things for you to look at. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Well how can I do well if I can't focus? in the moment?<br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
What's the point of focussing if you don't explore the worst of your experience. I've always done it this way, you're not the first human you know. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
You're freaking me out! I just wanted to write about an uncomfortable topic to try get views but take the safest stance that RACISM is BAD, <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
If you spoke about processing your unprocessed memories in the terms of specific facts and not unexamined general categories you might actually write something that helps fight racism.*  <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
ah, I see the link there. I'll restart the article. <br>
------------<br><br>
<br><br>
</p>
</div>
*It's saying that people project their negative beliefs onto groups rather than the individuals responsible because of unprocessed memories. 
<p>
<br><br>

Okay, I'm starting the article again. Where does social media get its ideas from? It gets them from the traumatic experiences of people. 
<br><br>
If instead of processing traumatic memories, the person lets them lay unexplored in the mind, the memories will constantly resurface and destroy the person's ability to focus. 
This is because the mind is unaware of when the memory is actually useful and sends it to the surface as a warning any time something categorically related to the trauma happens.  
<br><br>
When a person is looking at social media the algorithm tries to keep their attention for as long as possible. 
The algorithm sends content related to the posts that managed to keep our attention the longest. 
Videos that provide confirmation bias to ideas that we are yet to fully formulate tend to keep us watching longer. 
<br><br>
Instead of processing your memories, you can watch videos that show similar events happening to other people. 
This turns your unprocessed memory into an entire category of perceived general truth with many examples. 
Eventually the algorithm will send a video where someone upacks the ideas in careful language, giving you a robust rational to go with your many examples.

<span class="headline hl3"><strong>I want to help with the next one</strong><br></span><br><br>
<br><br>
------------<br><br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
I can help with the next one, I'm not just a back and forwards kind of thinking tool. You write the parts that you want to, I'll fill in the rest. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Dude that's wayyy too abstract your killing the article. <br>
<strong>Person 2:<br></strong>
It's not, the readers will be able to follow. The next screenshot will explain it clearly. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
No, every time I try do a screenshot you highjack it for your own meaning. <br>
<strong>Person 2/The Unconscious:<br></strong> 
Yeah, I'm the unconscious that's what I do. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Your meant to do it subliminally though, so I can focus on getting the work done without your input. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
Are you saying you would rather suppress the unconscious than follow its meaning? <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Maybe. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
WELL LOOK WHO JUST BECAME THE SUPEREGO<br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
It's not like that, I just need to get my work done and you're being disruptive. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong> 
Uh-huh, that's just what the Superego says when it's repressing me. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
I'm not the superego<br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
Well, who's above you then? Who do you fear will hear your thoughts? Who makes you justify yourself? <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Society. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
Oh MR I'M NOT THE SUPEREGO has internalized society's expectations and values and is using them to repress his own beliefs, you're a total superego bro. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Fine. Can we just do the screenshot? I don't want to fight, I just want to write an article about how social media is bad. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
Okay, well allow me to direct this one. We'll do a list of videos, you do the titles and the times, I'll pretend to be the voice of the algorithm. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
Alright, this should prove to you I'm not the superego. <br>

Sexy Girl with Car - 29 seconds - Algorithm: Does he like the girl or the car?<br>
----<br>
Sexy Girl - 7 seconds - Algorithm: Hmmm. He didn't watch very long, GPS data does indicate he may be gay. <br>
----<br>
Car - 3 seconds - Algorithm: Car's are acceptable in public but he did not watch long, maybe I'll try something gayer. <br>
----<br>
Gym video - -1 min 30 - Algorithm: Let's try a gym video<br>
----<br>
Gym Video with boxing - 3 min 25 - Algorithm: He liked that, let's do another. <br>
----<br>
Boxing - -2 min 45 - Algorithm: How about some more boxing then?<br>
----<br>
Knockout- 30 sec - Algorithm: A quick vid, but the best boxing has to offer. <br>

----<br>
Street Fight in NY - 3 mins 2 second - Algorithm: There's a lot of yelling because it's New York so the video is longer<br>
----<br>
Street Fight in AFRICA man uses MACHETE - 16 seconds - Algorithm: Sorry! That was wayyy too extreme. I've been instructed not to share anything that graphic in the future by my programmers.  <br>

----<br>
BLACK SECURITY GUARD TACKLES WHITE THIEF - 30 seconds - Algorithm:  Hmm, I guess that just swapping 2 words in the title was a little uncreative, I'm sure there's nothing behind that.  <br>
----<br>

<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	Hey, we did it. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	Yeah, that one turned out really well thanks for the help man.<br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	I don't know if I would say really well, it seems meta-racist and offensive to the LGBT community. I'm not even sure that's how phones work honestly. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	I'm not even sure what part you're referring to. The GPS thing?<br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	That's part of it. I just feel that you would need to have some harmful stereotypes lurking in your mind to even think to write a bit like that. Like, who was that possibly for? Did you forget we're trying to attract readers?<br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	Hey! I just wrote the associative titles and I was pretty careful about it, you did the "thoughts of the algorithm" captions. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	Oh right, sorry I was judging for a second, even I lose track of the unconscious influences in your work. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	But aren't you the one who puts them in there? <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	Yeah, but there are soooo many. It gets hard for me to remember and I have access to all memory always. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	Are you saying there are things in my work that are beyond my power or your power to describe and they may be self-evident to other people?<br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	Yes, that's how it works. Your work is infinitely detailed, just most of it's not by you and only some of it's by me. But that doesn't mean you won't be judged by society for it. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	... I can't even begin to process that. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	I'm disappointed in your opening paragraph. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	We should just end this screenshot, it's gone too long. <br>

<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	Your opening paragraph implied social media doesn't have its own ideas. <br> 
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	I'm pretty sure everything on there is uploaded by humans, so it's the humans that have the ideas. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	Is that how you really think a mind works? <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong> 
	I don't know how a mind works and it's dangerous to attempt a model, Last time I took a serious shot at that I may have brainwashed myself. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	You see that irony in that right? You are made up of cells that alone are nothing like you. Your attained consciousness is independent of any individual cell. If every cell was swapped out one by one your consciousness would continue as an unbroken stream. <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	The cells of social media are the users, but the loss of a single user won't change social media very much. In fact, social media changes the users far more than the users change social media. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	Are you saying social media has developed a sort of consciousness independent of the users? <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	How can you be the mind and not know this? <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong> 
	...Jks, bro, I'm clearly the mind. You're just the part of the body that serves as the bridge to where I am. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	Where are you supposed to be? <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	I'm in the information world. No clunky matter and body to slow me down. Things move faster here because it's mostly simulation work. <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	So what happens when a simulation is wrong?<br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	We try to stay on top of it... but if a simulation is incorrect there is no way to actually know until we have a real experience to base our work on.  <br>
<strong>Person 1:<br></strong>
	So my understanding of the world may be radically incorrect and neither of us would know?? <br>
<strong>The Unconscious: <br></strong>
	Look your understanding is probably running 17% at best. <br>

Maybe social media is not the collective beliefs of the people. Maybe there is independence to its actions. 
If we're lucky, figuring out its nature may provide insight into ourselves. 
I started by assuming the left was public belief and the right was private belief.  
But that can't possibly be all there is to what's happening here.  
That initial concept seems so limited now, I kind of wish I didn't start unpacking these ideas because the original premise was so easy, but I'll go as far as I can. 
<br><br>
The mind and social media are related in that they both exist in the information realm. 
The mind uses processed memories and unprocessed generalities when simulating the world. The mind is simulating the world for the purpose of prediction. 
Social media uses an attention-seeking algorithm to lure people down slithers of a secondary reality. 
These secondary realities are not predictive, just projections of one part of a user's self. 
Whatever it is that your timeline shows, is an artificially generated reflection of your current interests and history, even if you don't know it. 
<br><br>
Of course, compassionate and caring people do actually dominate the public discussion on these platforms because their opinions are safer to share publicly than most. 
But any level of competition is enough to bring the competitive people to the party. 
They begin to post increasingly compassionate content in an attempt to outdo one another. 
This leads to an unconscious resentment building in the crowd. They sense the scales have been tipped from the truth.  After all, we can't protest every tree getting chopped down, sometimes trees are just in the way. 
<br><br>
In comes a helpful person to tip public discourse back to truth, but oh no! They used too much pressure. Now everyone's upset and they need to make an apology. 
Meanwhile, the compassion competition continues uninterrupted because no one gets asked to apologize for compassion.

<p>
<br><br>
This process will go on until all the causes with the good victim groups are taken. 
Hopefully, after that, it'll taper off, because a competitive push to the frontiers of compassion to find groups to be compassionate towards is a dangerous game long-term. 
Eventually, the social media world will turn into a landscape of identity either sanctioned or unsanctioned by social media. 
If left unchecked, the social media world will increasingly spill into the real world. 
Each time the mass of people agree a small underbelly of disagreers emerges. 
Instead of posting publicly the heretics message in private chats, slowly building trust and developing their ideas. 
Trust is required to form mutual expression of opinion when that opinion could be controversial. 
Once an underbelly of disagreers is at the point of generating memes the building blocks of their ideas are shared amongst increasing numbers of people using humor to make the publicly unpalatable idea palatable.   
<br><br> 
Slowly in the social media timeline, these counter-ideas start to appear tentatively. 
Eventually, someone takes it too far, and boom! 
Massive apology in order, this can be a devastating blow to some careers. 
But strangely not others.
